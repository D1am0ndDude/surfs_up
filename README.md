## Surfs Up Analysis

# Overview 
In order to be positive about opening an ice cream/surf board shop in Oahu, we first need to check the temperatures year round. If the weather drops too far, no one would want to eat ice cream, or surf. Our client wants to get an anaylsis on the weather in both June, and December. 

# Results
The Dataframe below summarize June's temperature statistics over the last Seven Years.

Here is what we found from these two tables, after analysing both months. 

1. The average, or mean tempurature between both months were in the low 70s. Displaying very low fluctuation between the months, despite one of the months being winter.
2. The minimum temperature for June is 64, and December is 56. When temperatures do reach that low, it would be too cold for ice cream and surfing.
3. Both June and Decembers maximum temperatures were in the mid 80s. Both highs are about equal to one another.

# Summary
Based on the analysis, the temperatures are very consistent. High 70s and low 80s is a comfortable tempurate to enjoy some ice cream. The only downside is the minimum temperatures. 50 Degree weather is not ideal for setting up shop, but given it's only the month of December that is a bit colder, business will still be an excellent idea. The results came back very positive.
